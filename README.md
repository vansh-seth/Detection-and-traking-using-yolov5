# Real-Time Shuttle Detection and Tracking using YOLOv5

This project utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect and track shuttles in real-time video streams. The system is capable of accurately identifying shuttles in various environmental conditions and dynamically generates bounding boxes around them.

## Features

- Real-time shuttle detection and tracking
- Accurate bounding box generation
- Compatibility with various video input sources
- Lightweight and efficient implementation using YOLOv5

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended for better performance)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vansh-seth/Detection-and-traking-using-yolov5.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
02_predictions.ipynb
```

2. Provide the path to the video file or use a webcam for real-time detection.

3. The system will detect and track shuttles in the video stream, displaying bounding boxes around them.
